![An image of an app mock-up for the alt-text generator.](alt-text-generator.png)

Need to generate alt-text for a bulk set of images? This sample provides a basic alt-text generator that iterates over images in a specified folder, converts each image to base64 data URL, generates alt-text for each converted image, and then organizes everything into a markdown file - providing both the file name and alt-text!

*Note: If you only need to generate alt-text for a single image, check out the [TBD] generator.*
