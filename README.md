# <p align="center">Alt-Text Generator</p>

![Illustration of a Gen AI Alt-Text Generator. The left side describes its function: generating alt text for image sets using Python and OpenAI. An arrow points from an image icon to a document icon, indicating the process of converting images to text and organizing them in a markdown file.](alt-text-generator.png)

Need to generate alt-text for a bulk set of images? This sample provides a basic alt-text generator that iterates over images in a specified folder, converts each image to base64 data URL, generates alt-text for each converted image, and then organizes everything into a markdown file - providing both the file name and alt-text!

*Note: If you only need to generate alt-text for a single image, check out the [TBD] generator.*
